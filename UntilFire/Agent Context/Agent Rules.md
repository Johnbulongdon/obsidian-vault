# UntilFire Agent Rules

This repository uses `origin/main` as the canonical baseline for all work by default.

## Baseline Rule

Before making any change:

1. Fetch `origin/main`.
2. Compare the local workspace against `origin/main`.
3. Treat the latest pushed `origin/main` version as the baseline.

Do not use older local commit history or unpushed local workspace changes as the baseline unless the user explicitly says to.

## Local Workspace Drift

If local files differ from `origin/main`:

- preserve those local changes
- do not assume they are the intended base
- continue reasoning from `origin/main` unless the user explicitly overrides that rule

## UI Work

For design-sensitive work:

- use `origin/main` as the code baseline
- use the live deployment or user-provided screenshots as verification
- if the live deployment and `origin/main` visibly differ, call that out before implementing or pushing

## Deployment References

If the user references a build or deployment identifier such as `6Tb7dySgE`, do not assume it is a git revision. Treat it as a deployment reference unless verified otherwise.

## Push Discipline

Before pushing visual changes, restate the baseline in plain language:

- `Using latest pushed GitHub main as base`

If the requested design direction conflicts with `origin/main`, say so before pushing.

## Standard Publish Path

The standard publish path is the GitHub connector.

1. Validate locally against the latest pushed `origin/main` baseline.
2. Publish through the GitHub connector first.
3. Use raw `git push` only as a secondary transport when it is healthy and does not conflict with the connector path.
4. If local git networking fails, continue publishing through the connector rather than switching baselines or leaving local-only commits as the source of truth.

For larger changes, prefer a connector-backed branch or staged commit flow over direct local-only history.
