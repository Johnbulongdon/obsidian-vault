## What is UntilFire?

UntilFire is a **personal FIRE adviser** — the app that answers the question most people don't know how to ask: *"Can I actually FIRE? Where do I stand right now? And what should I do about it?"*

In 60 seconds with no login, you find out whether early retirement is achievable for you — personalised to your city, income, and taxes, not a national average. Then the dashboard keeps score and the adviser tells you exactly what to do each month to move your date earlier.

The market is split between tools that are too simple to trust (FIRECalc, cFIREsim) and tools that are too complex to give you clear next steps (ProjectionLab, Boldin). Both leave you alone after giving you a number or a model. UntilFire doesn't. It stays with you, tracks what's actually happening, and gives you one clear action at a time.

Free tier: full FIRE calculator, no login, 263 cities worldwide.  
Pro ($9/mo): your personal FIRE adviser — monthly action plan based on your actual spending, not generic tips.

**One-line pitch:** Know if you can FIRE and where you stand — then let your adviser tell you what to do next.

## Key Product Decisions

- **No login wall** on the calculator 鈥?friction-free discovery is the growth strategy
- **Search-as-you-type** city search (not country 鈫?state 鈫?city cascade)
- **25脳 rule** with 7% real annual return assumption
- **Custom city fallback** 鈥?user enters monthly expenses in USD if their city isn't listed
- **Syne + DM Sans + DM Mono** font stack; dark theme (#08080e background, #f97316 orange accent, #22d3a5 teal)
- Wizard state lives in `app/page.tsx` only 鈥?not in URL params or global state

---

## Repo Workflow Rule

- **Canonical baseline:** latest pushed GitHub `origin/main`
- **Local unpushed changes:** preserve them, but do not treat them as baseline by default
- **Live Vercel:** verification target for UI work, not the primary implementation baseline unless explicitly requested
- **Deployment/build IDs:** treat identifiers such as `6Tb7dySgE` as deployment references unless confirmed to be git revisions
