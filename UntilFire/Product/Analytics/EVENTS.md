# UntilFire Funnel Events - v1 Contract

This is the canonical contract for the v1 conversion funnel. Every event
listed here has a single emit site in code; if you add a new emit site,
update this doc in the same change.

The contract is also encoded in `lib/analytics-events.ts`. That file is the
runtime source of truth - the constants there are imported by every emit
site, so a typo in code is a TypeScript error rather than a silently renamed
event in PostHog. **This doc and that file must stay in sync.**

## Funnel order

```
funnel_landing_viewed
  → [primary] funnel_calculator_step_viewed (step_id=city)
           → funnel_calculator_step_viewed (step_id=income)
           → funnel_calculator_step_viewed (step_id=savings)
           → funnel_calculator_step_viewed (step_id=portfolio)
           → funnel_calculator_revealed
           → funnel_signup_started
           → funnel_signup_completed
           → funnel_dashboard_first_view
           → funnel_paywall_viewed     (helper exposed; emit site lands with paywall UI)
           → funnel_checkout_started   (helper exposed; emit site lands with paywall UI)
           → funnel_checkout_succeeded (server, Stripe webhook)

  → [quiz branch] funnel_fire_type_started  (on first answer)
               → funnel_fire_type_completed (on result mount)
               → funnel_fire_type_shared    (optional, on share action)
               → funnel_fire_type_cta_clicked → rejoins primary funnel
```

## PII rules

- No emails, names, raw addresses, or precise dollar amounts in property
  payloads.
- FIRE target and years-to-FIRE are bucketed (`bucketUSD` / `bucketYears` in
  `lib/analytics-events.ts`).
- `scenario_id` is only attached after auth (dashboard first view onward).
- Pre-auth events ride PostHog's anonymous `distinct_id`. After signup we
  call `posthog.identify(userId)` so the anonymous funnel stitches to the
  authenticated person.
- `funnel_event_version` is attached to every event so we can evolve the
  contract without breaking historical queries.
- `landing_source` is a coarse route/source label such as `learn-hub`,
  `calculator-savings-rate`, or `fire-number-austin-tx`. It is used for
  acquisition attribution, not personal identification.

## Events

### `funnel_landing_viewed`

- **Where**: `app/page.tsx`, `Home` screen effect when `screen === 'hero'`.
- **Properties**:
  - `landing_source` - optional route/source label when the visitor arrived
    from an internal content page or acquisition landing page.

### `funnel_calculator_step_viewed`

- **Where**: `app/page.tsx`, `Home` screen effect when the wizard transitions
  to one of the four steps.
- **Properties**:
  - `step_id` - `city` | `income` | `savings` | `portfolio`.
  - `step_index` - `1..4`. Mirrors `step_id` for funnel ordering in PostHog.
  - `landing_source` - optional route/source label.

### `funnel_calculator_revealed`

- **Where**: `app/page.tsx`, `RevealScreen` effect, fired exactly once per
  mount when the reveal animation fully settles (`revealed === true`).
- **Properties**:
  - `state_key` - tax jurisdiction key (e.g. `CA`, `TX`, `custom`).
  - `is_custom_city` - boolean. `true` for custom monthly-expense entries.
  - `fire_target_bucket` - `lt_250k` | `250k_500k` | `500k_1m` | `1m_2m`
    | `2m_5m` | `gte_5m`.
  - `years_to_fire_bucket` - `lt_5` | `5_10` | `10_20` | `20_30` | `gte_30`.
  - `landing_source` - optional route/source label.

### `funnel_signup_started`

- **Where**: `app/login/page.tsx`, click handler on the Google sign-in
  button.
- **Properties**:
  - `from_calculator` - boolean. `true` when a calculator prefill is present
    (i.e. the user came from the reveal CTA).
  - `state_key` - optional. Mirrors the prefill's tax jurisdiction.
  - `landing_source` - optional route/source label carried from the page
    that introduced the visitor to the calculator.

### `funnel_signup_completed`

- **Where**: `app/auth/callback/page.tsx`, fired after Supabase finishes the
  OAuth callback and a session is available.
- **Properties**: none beyond defaults.
- **Side effect**: `posthog.identify(userId)` runs alongside the event.

### `funnel_dashboard_first_view`

- **Where**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`, the session-load `useEffect` after
  `loadDefaultScenario` resolves. Fires once per dashboard mount.
- **Properties**:
  - `had_calculator_prefill` - boolean.
  - `via_upgrade` - boolean. `true` when the URL carries `?upgraded=true`
    (i.e. landing from a Stripe checkout success redirect).
  - `scenario_id` - UUID of the user's default scenario.

### `funnel_paywall_viewed`

- **Status**: helper exposed (`trackPaywallViewed(surface)`), no emit site
  yet. The paywall UI lands in a separate issue; that change is required to
  call this helper.
- **Properties**:
  - `surface` - short label for where the paywall rendered (e.g.
    `dashboard_upgrade_card`).

### `funnel_checkout_started`

- **Status**: helper exposed (`trackCheckoutStarted(surface)`), no emit site
  yet. Wire this to whatever button POSTs to `/api/stripe/checkout`.
- **Properties**:
  - `surface` - short label for the click origin.

### `funnel_checkout_succeeded`

- **Where**: **server** - `app/api/stripe/webhook/route.ts`, on the
  `checkout.session.completed` event after the subscriptions row upsert
  succeeds. Sent via `lib/analytics-server.ts` over the PostHog public
  capture endpoint (`${NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST}/capture/`).
- **`distinct_id`**: Supabase `user_id` from the checkout session metadata
  (`metadata.supabase_user_id`). This stitches into the same person as the
  client identify call.
- **Properties**:
  - `plan` - `pro`.
  - `price_id` - Stripe price id from the subscription (optional if Stripe
    omits it).
  - `stripe_session_id` - the Stripe Checkout Session id.
  - `mode` - `subscription`.
  - `source` - `stripe_webhook`.

The server is the source of truth for checkout success. We deliberately do
not fire a client-side echo on `/dashboard?upgraded=true`; the dashboard
first-view event with `via_upgrade=true` is enough to spot-check the
client-side experience without double-counting conversions.

### `funnel_fire_type_started`

- **Where**: `app/fire-type/page.tsx`, fired on the user's first quiz answer (confirms real engagement, not just page load).
- **Properties**:
  - `source` — optional. Acquisition source (e.g. `homepage-secondary`).

### `funnel_fire_type_completed`

- **Where**: `app/fire-type/page.tsx`, `useEffect` on `stage === 'result'` mount.
- **Properties**:
  - `fire_type_code` — the 4-letter result code (e.g. `PSGB`). Not PII — it is a preference category, not a financial number.
  - `source` — optional.

### `funnel_fire_type_shared`

- **Where**: `app/fire-type/page.tsx`, share button handler after successful share or clipboard copy.
- **Properties**:
  - `fire_type_code` — 4-letter result code.
  - `share_method` — `native` | `clipboard`.

### `funnel_fire_type_cta_clicked`

- **Where**: `app/fire-type/page.tsx`, onClick on the "Calculate my actual FIRE number" CTA link.
- **Properties**:
  - `fire_type_code` — 4-letter result code.
  - `source` — optional.

## Adding a new event

1. Add the event name to `FunnelEvents` in `lib/analytics-events.ts`.
2. Add a property interface and helper in `lib/analytics.ts` (or
   `lib/analytics-server.ts` for server-only events).
3. Call the helper from exactly one site.
4. Document the event in this file.

## Verification

- The smoke window for this issue is the first 24 hours after deploy.
  Acceptance is non-zero counts for the public-calculator events
  (`funnel_landing_viewed`, `funnel_calculator_step_viewed`,
  `funnel_calculator_revealed`).
- The PostHog project for verification is the one configured by
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST` (see Vercel env).
