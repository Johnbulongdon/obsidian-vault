# UntilFire — User Journey Map
Last updated: March 2026

---

## Journey Overview

UntilFire has two distinct user journeys:

1. **The Calculator Journey** — anonymous user discovers FIRE number (5 screens, ~60 seconds)
2. **The Tracker Journey** — signed-in user tracks real progress toward FIRE (ongoing)

The calculator journey is the acquisition funnel. The tracker journey is retention and monetisation.

---

## Journey 1: The Calculator (Anonymous)

### Stage 0 — Discovery

**How users arrive:**
- Reddit link (r/financialindependence, r/personalfinance, r/FIRE)
- X/Twitter post from @GetUntilFire
- Direct Google search ("FIRE calculator", "when can I retire calculator")
- Word of mouth — someone shares their FIRE number
- City SEO landing pages (future)

**User mental state:** Curious, slightly sceptical. Has heard of FIRE but never calculated their own number. Expecting either a generic result or a complicated form.

**Success metric**: User clicks the CTA.

---

### Stage 1 — Hero Screen

**What user sees:**
- "Your spending is costing you years of freedom"
- Single button: "Calculate my FIRE number"
- Social proof: "2,400+ FIRE seekers this month"
- Market stats: $5.8B market, 2.2M Reddit members, 25% Gen Z targeting early retirement

**User thought:** "OK so this is actually a real thing, not just a random calculator. And I don't have to sign up. Let me try it."

**Friction points:** None intentional. If the page loads slowly, user may bounce.

**Success metric**: Click "Calculate my FIRE number" → proceed to City screen.

---

### Stage 2 — City Selection (Step 1 of 3)

**What user sees:**
- Search input: "Start typing your city or country"
- Dropdown appears as user types — shows flag, city name, estimated annual expenses, FIRE target
- After selecting: city info card shows annual expenses, FIRE target (25×), vs. US average delta
- Custom city option always visible at bottom of dropdown: "Enter my monthly expenses"

**User thought:** "Let me find my city... oh there it is / oh it's not there let me use the custom one. And I can see the estimated expenses — looks about right."

**Friction points:**
- City not in list → mitigated by custom city fallback
- Estimated expenses feel wrong → user can override with custom entry

**Key interactions:**
1. User types city name → dropdown filters in real time
2. User selects city → info card appears, Continue button enables
3. If city not found → user clicks "📍 [city] — enter my monthly expenses"
4. Custom panel appears → user enters monthly amount → clicks "Use this"

**Success metric**: City selected (or custom amount confirmed) → Continue clicked.

---

### Stage 3 — Income Input (Step 2 of 3)

**What user sees:**
- Number input + slider for annual gross income (default $90,000)
- Slider range: $20k–$500k (accepts higher via direct input)
- Real-time updates showing:
  - Gross income
  - After-tax take-home
  - Monthly take-home
  - Tax breakdown (federal / state / FICA for US; flat rate for international)
  - Real hourly rate ("$32.88/hr based on 2,080 working hours/yr")

**User thought:** "Oh interesting — I actually only take home $68k of my $90k. And my real hourly rate is only $32? That's lower than I thought."

**Emotional beat:** A small insight moment — seeing effective taxes clearly for the first time creates engagement and a sense of "this tool gets it."

**Friction points:**
- User earns over $500k — slider maxes out visually but number input accepts any value
- International users may not recognise the tax calculation as relevant — it's simplified to a flat effective rate for them

**Success metric**: User enters their income and clicks Continue.

---

### Stage 4 — Savings Input (Step 3 of 3)

**What user sees:**
- Number input + slider for monthly savings (default $1,500)
- Real-time savings rate % and benchmark label (Very low / Average / Good / FIRE pace)
- Progress bar: 0% → 20% (Good) → 50% (FIRE pace)
- Stat cards: monthly savings amount + savings rate %

**User thought:** "My savings rate is 26% — that's 'Average'. I wonder what happens if I bump it up to 30%... Let me try."

**Emotional beat:** The savings rate label creates a mild competitive impulse — most users nudge the slider to get a better label before proceeding.

**Friction points:**
- User doesn't know how much they're saving → they estimate (acceptable — not asking for precision)
- User saves in non-USD currency → we're asking for USD equivalent (minor friction for international)

**Success metric**: User enters savings and clicks "Show my FIRE number 🔥".

---

### Stage 5 — The Reveal (The Big Moment)

**What user sees:**

**Phase 1 — Calculating (~3 seconds):**
- "Running your projection…"
- 4 calculation steps light up one by one (620ms each):
  - City cost-of-living → After-tax income → Compound growth at 7% → 25× withdrawal rule
- Progress bar fills to 100%
- 800ms pause at 100% (anticipation beat)

**Phase 2 — The Number:**
- Number slams in from 55% scale with spring animation
- Count-up over 2.2 seconds from $0 to FIRE target
- Orange glow effect pulses on the number
- Below the number: "You could retire in [year] — age [age]"
- Small caption: "Calculated for [city]"

**After reveal (once count-up completes):**
- "Your spending is costing you X years of freedom" statement
- 4 delta cards: cut dining / save $500 more / 10% pay cut / invest bonus
- CTA: "Make this more accurate — it's free →" (→ dashboard signup)
- Secondary: "← Adjust inputs"

**User emotional arc:**
1. **Anticipation** — the calculating phase builds suspense
2. **Impact** — the slam animation makes the number feel significant
3. **Reality check** — the retire year and age make it personal
4. **Curiosity** — delta cards create "what if" thinking
5. **Action** — CTA captures the motivated state

**The critical moment**: Users who see a retire date that feels achievable (under 20 years) convert to signups at a much higher rate. Users who see 35+ years are at risk of abandoning unless the delta cards show meaningful improvement options.

**Success metrics:**
- Completion rate (savings screen → reveal): target >75%
- Share rate: target >10% of completions
- Signup rate (reveal → dashboard): target >25%

### Stage 6 — Post-Reveal Paths

**Path A: Signs up immediately**
- Clicks "Make this more accurate — it's free →"
- Google OAuth screen
- → Dashboard with FIRE number locked in
- → Prompted to add real expense data

**Path B: Shares number**
- Copies share text / uses native share
- Posts on Reddit/X: "just ran my FIRE number, it's $X..."
- Drives organic referrals (viral loop)

**Path C: Adjusts inputs**
- Clicks "← Adjust inputs" → returns to savings screen
- Experiments with different savings amounts
- May also restart with a different city
- Eventually follows Path A or B

**Path D: Bounces**
- Number feels too far away, no clear next step
- Retention lever: waitlist signup at bottom of page

---

## Journey 2: The Tracker (Logged-In User)

### Onboarding (Day 1)

1. User arrives at dashboard post-OAuth
2. Sees their FIRE target from the calculator
3. Prompted to: "Add your first expense to start tracking"
4. Connects expense log → starts logging

### Weekly Usage

1. Log expenses as they happen (or in bulk weekly)
2. Dashboard shows: current savings rate, FIRE progress %, projection chart
3. FIRE date updates in real time as expenses are logged
4. Insights appear (planned: AI-powered)

### Monthly Usage

1. Review monthly spending report
2. Compare actual savings rate vs. target
3. See how FIRE date moved (earlier or later)
4. Adjust savings targets if needed

### Paid Conversion Point

1. User sees "AI Roadmap" feature locked behind Pro ($9/mo)
2. Prompt: "Get a personalised monthly plan to retire faster"
3. User enters payment details → unlocks AI advisor

## Drop-Off Points & Mitigations

| Stage | Drop-off risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Hero → City | Low intent visitor | Strong headline, social proof, zero friction |
| City → Income | City not in list | Custom city fallback with manual monthly input |
| Income → Savings | User doesn't know exact savings | Default value ($1,500), note saying "estimate is fine" |
| Savings → Reveal | None significant | Button copy "Show my FIRE number 🔥" creates excitement |
| Reveal → Signup | Long timeline discourages | Delta cards show how to improve; waitlist captures non-converters |
| Dashboard → Retention | Logging friction | Quick-add expense buttons, weekly recap email (planned) |
| Free → Paid | Price sensitivity | AI roadmap feature must feel meaningfully valuable |
