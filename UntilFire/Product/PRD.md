# UntilFire — Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Last updated: March 2026

---

## Problem Statement

Most people have no idea when they can retire or what "financial independence" actually means for them personally. The tools that exist are either:
- Too complex (ProjectionLab, Boldin) — overwhelming for beginners
- Too simple and generic (online calculators) — use national averages, ignore taxes, ignore real cost of living
- Too expensive ($99–$144/yr) — creating friction before users see any value

**The core insight**: your FIRE number is not universal. A person retiring in Austin, TX needs a completely different number than someone in San Francisco, London, or Bangkok. No free tool shows you this clearly.

---

## Product Vision

> "The fastest way for anyone in the world to understand their FIRE number — personalised to their city, their income, and their taxes — with zero friction."

UntilFire is the **entry point** to FIRE planning: simple enough that someone can get their number in 60 seconds, credible enough that they trust it, and compelling enough that they want to go deeper.

---

## Target User

See [PERSONAS.md](./PERSONAS.md) for full profiles. In brief:

- **Primary**: 25–38 year old knowledge workers (tech, finance, healthcare) who earn $70k–$200k, have heard of FIRE, and want to know if it's achievable for them
- **Secondary**: International users — particularly China, India, Southeast Asia, Middle East — who have no FIRE tools built for their cost of living
- **Tertiary**: Digital nomads evaluating geo-arbitrage scenarios

## FIRE Calculation Methodology

```
FIRE Target = Annual Expenses × 25   (the "25× rule" / 4% safe withdrawal rate)

Annual Expenses = city.col (our estimated annual living cost for that city in USD)
                OR user-entered monthly expenses × 12 (custom city)

Years to FIRE:
  Starting balance = $27,400 (assumed existing savings)
  Each year: balance = balance × 1.07 + (monthly savings × 12)
  Loop until balance ≥ FIRE Target or 65 years

Tax (US cities):
  Federal: 2025 brackets with $15,000 standard deduction
  FICA: 6.2% SS (up to $176,100) + 1.45% Medicare + 0.9% Additional Medicare (>$200k)
  State: flat effective rate by state

Tax (international):
  Single flat effective rate by country
  No FICA equivalent applied
```
