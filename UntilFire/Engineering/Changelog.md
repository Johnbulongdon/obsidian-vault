# Changelog

All notable changes to UntilFire are documented here.

## [Unreleased] - 2026-05-02

### Changed
- `supabase-setup.sql` rewritten to match the live app: drops the legacy `user_plans` schema and now creates `user_budget`, `expenses`, `subscriptions`, and `waitlist` with RLS policies + `updated_at` triggers. Idempotent — safe to re-run.
- `AUTH_SETUP.md` rewritten against the live architecture: documents Google OAuth via `/login` → `/auth/callback`, removes the stale `middleware.ts` references, and lists the env vars and fresh-setup steps that map to the rewritten SQL.

### Verification
- `npm run typecheck` passes against the rewritten docs/SQL changes (no TS files were modified).
- SQL parses to four tables (`user_budget`, `expenses`, `subscriptions`, `waitlist`), ten RLS policies, and three `updated_at` triggers — matches every `.from(...)` call in the active routes (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`, `app/dashboard/TransactionsTab.tsx`, `app/api/stripe/**`, `app/api/waitlist/route.ts`, `lib/supabase.ts getSubscription`).
- `middleware.ts` confirmed absent from the repo; route protection on `/dashboard` is the existing client-side session redirect, consistent with `docs/DECISIONS.md` (2026-03 Supabase + RLS decision).

### Known follow-ups
- Components in `/components` (`CalculatorForm`, `PlanList`, `LogStashForm`, `QuickAddButton`, `ProjectionChart`) are orphaned — they reference the dropped `user_plans` / `stash_history` tables but are not imported by any active route. Candidate for deletion in a follow-up cleanup task.
- `docs/CONTEXT.md` still lists `app/expenses/page.tsx` (does not exist; the live route is `app/transactions/page.tsx` redirecting into `/dashboard?tab=expenses`) and the orphaned components — flagged for the same cleanup pass.
