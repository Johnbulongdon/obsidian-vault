# UntilFire — Product Roadmap
Last updated: May 2026

---

## Product Direction

**Positioning:** Find your freedom date.

UntilFire shows when work can become optional — your FIRE number, your timeline, and the monthly moves that can bring freedom closer. Free, no login.

**North star:** Turn financial independence from an abstract calculator result into a clear, emotional, actionable path: *when can work become optional, and what can I do this month to bring that date closer?*

**Product principles:**
- Lead with the emotional outcome: freedom date, work optional, escape the grind.
- Keep the first value moment free, fast, and no-login.
- Show specific monthly moves, not generic FIRE advice.
- Make calculations feel trustworthy with transparent assumptions, privacy reassurance, and clear methodology.
- Treat the dashboard and Pro tier as continuity after the first aha moment, not a replacement for the free calculator.
- Do not hide the aha moment behind login, payment, or heavy setup.

## Phase 2 — Built Recently, Needs Production Verification 🧪

*Goal: Do not rebuild what exists. Verify, harden, and decide whether each feature belongs in the Product Hunt path.*

### Monetisation / Pro

- [x] Stripe checkout route: `/api/stripe/checkout`
- [x] Stripe portal route: `/api/stripe/portal`
- [x] Stripe webhook route: `/api/stripe/webhook`
- [x] Stripe subscription sync route: `/api/stripe/sync-subscription`
- [x] Dashboard upgrade modal connected to checkout
- [x] Subscription table/schema present
- [ ] Verify production Stripe env vars and webhook signing secret on Vercel
- [ ] Test full checkout → dashboard return → subscription sync → portal flow
- [ ] Decide exact launch paywall: what stays free, what Pro unlocks, and how aggressively to show upgrade prompts

### Bank Connection / Plaid

- [x] Plaid server routes: create link token, exchange token, sync, disconnect, list items, accounts
- [x] Plaid dashboard UI in Cashflow/Profile
- [x] Free users limited to 1 bank; Pro users can connect more
- [x] Plaid account balances feed Assets/Liabilities/Overview calculations
- [x] Plaid transaction import feeds Cashflow
- [ ] Verify production Plaid credentials and environment mode
- [ ] QA bank connection, sync, duplicate handling, disconnect, and account refresh
- [ ] Decide whether Plaid is a launch feature or hidden until after Product Hunt

### AI Categorisation

- [x] Client now calls server route `/api/categorise`
- [x] Server route uses `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` instead of exposing a client-side key
- [x] `.env.example` includes `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- [ ] Verify production env var is present
- [ ] QA categorisation accuracy and fallback behavior
- [ ] Add visible error/fallback handling if categorisation fails

### Distribution Experiments

- [x] FIRE Type quiz page at `/fire-type`
- [x] FIRE Type scoring and result storage in localStorage
- [x] FIRE Type native share / clipboard share
- [x] Fire Type analytics events
- [x] Public share page at `/share`
- [x] Dynamic OG image route for share cards
- [x] Decide whether FIRE Type is a primary Product Hunt asset or secondary acquisition experiment
- [x] Update share copy from “retire by” language to “freedom date / work optional” language

---

## Phase 3 — Product Hunt Readiness 🔥 Current Focus

*Goal: Make the public product strong enough for impatient launch traffic to understand, try, trust, and share.*

### Must Fix Before Launch

- [x] **Fix main CTA path:** clicking the primary homepage CTA must immediately open or scroll to the first calculator step. No dead-feeling click, hidden flow, or repeated CTA.
- [x] **Align live homepage copy:** hero should use “Find your freedom date” / “work can become optional” / “monthly moves that bring freedom closer.”
- [x] **Rename primary CTA:** prefer “Find my freedom date” over “Calculate my FIRE number.”
- [x] **Make first calculator step obvious:** show a clear “Step 1” prompt, input, progress, and continue button above the fold after CTA click.
- [x] **Show the differentiator visually:** above the fold or on the result screen, show example monthly moves like “Invest +$300/mo → freedom 1.8 years sooner.”
- [x] **Add trust line near hero/result:** privacy + transparent assumptions + city/tax methodology, e.g. “Private by default. No account required. Built with city-level cost and tax assumptions.”
- [x] **Update retirement-heavy copy:** replace “retire by” where it weakens the broader freedom/work-optional positioning.
- [ ] **Mobile QA:** complete full no-login calculator flow on mobile viewport and fix layout/CTA issues.
- [ ] **End-to-end no-login QA:** homepage → calculator → result → adjust inputs → share/save path must work without account creation.

### Product Hunt Launch Assets

- [ ] Product Hunt tagline: “Find your freedom date in 60 seconds.”
- [ ] Product Hunt short description: “UntilFire shows when work can become optional — your FIRE number, timeline, and the monthly moves that can bring freedom closer. Free, no login.”
- [ ] Maker first comment: personal story + why FIRE tools need to show what to do next, not just a number.
- [ ] 20–40 second demo GIF/video: enter inputs → get freedom date → see monthly moves.
- [ ] 3–5 screenshots: hero, calculator step, result, monthly moves, dashboard continuity.
- [ ] Simple FAQ answers: calculation assumptions, privacy, who it is for, why it is free.

### Shareability & Conversion

- [ ] Result page should produce a shareable insight without exposing sensitive finances.
- [ ] Refine `/share` and OG cards around freedom date or city insight, not raw net worth.
- [ ] Add “save my result” email capture after the reveal, not before the aha moment.
- [ ] Keep login secondary until after the user has seen value.
- [ ] Track funnel analytics: hero CTA click, calculator start, each step completion, result reveal, share/save/login clicks.

### Acceptance Criteria for Launch Readiness

- [ ] A new visitor can understand the product in 5 seconds.
- [ ] A new visitor can start the calculator in 1 click.
- [ ] A new visitor can reach a useful result in about 60 seconds.
- [ ] The result explains the FIRE number, timeline, and at least one concrete monthly move.
- [ ] The page answers “can I trust this?” before users ask.
- [ ] The launch page has no obvious broken CTA, console error, or mobile layout blocker.

## Phase 4 — Post-Launch Growth & Early Revenue 📈

*Goal: Convert launch attention into repeat usage, email leads, and first paying customers.*

### Growth

- [ ] Product Hunt launch and follow-up engagement
- [ ] Reddit launch post in relevant weekly promo/community threads
- [ ] Hacker News Show HN post
- [ ] X launch thread from @GetUntilFire
- [ ] City SEO expansion from first pages to 50+ pages
- [ ] FIRE topic pages linked from calculator/result flows

### Product

- [ ] Dashboard handoff that preserves calculator result and next action
- [ ] Sync custom categories/sub-categories to Supabase so they work across devices
- [ ] Persist active dashboard tab in URL query param, e.g. `?tab=reports`

### Monetisation

- [ ] Finalize free vs Pro packaging around the current $4.99/month Pro price
- [ ] Enforce Pro unlocks only after free value is delivered
- [ ] Email onboarding sequence: result saved, top move, dashboard reminder, Pro upgrade
- [ ] Pricing page copy aligned with “monthly moves adviser,” not generic dashboard access
- [ ] Keep actual Stripe price IDs in Vercel/env only, not docs or logs

- [ ] Advanced assumptions editor: returns, inflation, withdrawal rate, tax assumptions

- [ ] Embeddable FIRE/freedom-date calculator for partner sites
- [ ] Public methodology page for SEO and trust

## Priority Decisions

John has chosen the next product direction:

1. **Launch path:** Do private/friends beta and soft public launch on Reddit/X before Product Hunt.
2. **Readiness gate:** Use beta/soft-launch quotas before PH: roughly 50 real visitors, 20 completed freedom-date results, 5 feedback replies, and zero critical flow issues. Stronger gate: 100 visitors, 50 completed results, and 10 people willing to support/comment.
3. **Core aha:** Lead with “freedom date + one monthly move.” The result should not stop at a number/date.
4. **Plaid:** Keep bank connection as a logged-in dashboard feature after trust is built; do not make it central to Product Hunt.
5. **FIRE Type:** Keep quiz as a secondary social/share loop, not the main launch promise.
6. **Monetisation:** Keep Stripe/Pro infrastructure ready, but soft-hide paid conversion until the monthly moves adviser is stronger.
7. **Next sprint:** Product Hunt Funnel Sprint — fix CTA, update hero copy, show one monthly move, add trust line, QA mobile/no-login flow, update share copy, and prepare launch assets.

## What We're Deliberately NOT Building Yet

- Investment account aggregation as a Product Hunt launch dependency — too much trust/regulatory complexity before PMF
- Tax-loss harvesting advice — requires regulated advice boundaries
- Advisor marketplace — distracts from direct-to-consumer clarity
- Native mobile app — web-first until the funnel and retention are proven
- Heavy budgeting-app parity — UntilFire should show how money choices affect freedom, not become another generic budgeting tool
- Login-first onboarding — conflicts with the free/no-login first value promise
