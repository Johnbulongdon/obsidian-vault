# UNTAAAA-41 Follow-up Assessment: Closeout for UNTAAAA-33

Date: 2026-05-06
Owner: CTO Backup (Codex)
Parent audit: `docs/audits/UNTAAAA-33-codebase-audit-2026-05-05.md`

## Wake Acknowledgement
- Wake reason: `issue_assigned`
- Pending human comments in payload: `0/0`
- Effect on this heartbeat: proceed directly with closeout assessment and produce durable disposition for each follow-up item from UNTAAAA-33.

## Objective
Assess the UNTAAAA-33 recommendations against current repo state and determine which items can be closed under UNTAAAA-41 versus which must remain tracked as implementation work.

## Structured Plan
1. Re-validate each UNTAAAA-33 recommendation against current code/docs.
2. Classify each item as `Closed`, `Open`, or `Split Required`.
3. Define explicit unblock owner + next action for non-closed items.
4. Provide closeout recommendation for UNTAAAA-41.

## Re-Validation Results

### Item 1: Docs realignment pass (P0)
Status: Open

Evidence:
- `docs/modules/fire-dashboard.md` still lists primary route `/calculator`, but current implementation is dashboard + calculator subroutes under `/calculators/*`.
- `docs/modules/landing-wizard.md` still describes legacy 5-step flow and outdated `lib/fire-data.ts` responsibility.
- `docs/modules/ai-adviser.md` remains marked as planned while dashboard transactions already contain AI categorization behavior.

Conclusion:
- This recommendation is not complete and remains actionable.

### Item 2: Decision-platform v1 (P1)
Status: Open

Evidence:
- `lib/fire/scenarios.ts` confirms single-default-scenario seam is still enforced.
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` consumes one scenario and does not expose baseline-vs-candidate side-by-side scenario decisions as a first-class workflow.

Conclusion:
- Architecture seam exists, but productized decision workflow is not delivered.

### Item 3: Phase 2 distribution surface (P1)
Status: Open

Evidence:
- No `/fire-number/*` route family exists in `app/`.
- No evidence of city SEO template pages in current routes.
- Wizard includes monthly savings but not explicit existing-savings input in no-login flow.

Conclusion:
- Distribution and conversion surfaces remain materially incomplete.

### Item 4: Encoding remediation + decomposition (P2)
Status: Open

Evidence:
- `app/dashboard/page.tsx` still contains mojibake sequences (for example `鈹€...`, `�?`) in comments and UI strings.
- Large single-file route composition remains in `app/page.tsx` and `app/dashboard/page.tsx`.

Conclusion:
- Reliability/maintainability cleanup remains pending.

## Closeout Decision for UNTAAAA-41
Recommendation: Close UNTAAAA-41 as assessment-complete, with implementation tracked outside this follow-up issue.

Rationale:
- UNTAAAA-41 is a follow-up assessment issue, not the implementation container.
- Assessment objective is fulfilled: recommendations have been re-validated, dispositioned, and translated into explicit next actions.

## Required Next Actions (Implementation Track)
1. Create child issue: `Docs realignment P0` (owner: docs/CTO)
   - Update module docs to match live routes and actual wizard flow.
2. Create child issue: `Decision workflow v1` (owner: product engineering)
   - Expose scenario compare flow and decision-state UX in dashboard.
3. Create child issue: `SEO city pages + wizard existing savings` (owner: growth engineering)
   - Deliver first city landing set and extend wizard input model.
4. Create child issue: `Encoding cleanup + route decomposition` (owner: frontend engineering)
   - Remove mojibake and split oversized route files.

## Risks / Assumptions
- Assumes UNTAAAA-41 success criteria is follow-up assessment and closure recommendation, not direct implementation of UNTAAAA-33 backlog.
- Assumes child issues will be created in board workflow immediately after this closeout note.

## Final Disposition
- UNTAAAA-41 deliverable status: Complete (assessment done).
- UNTAAAA-33 implementation backlog status: Open (to be executed via child issues above).
