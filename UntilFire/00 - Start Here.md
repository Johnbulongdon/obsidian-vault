## Why UntilFire exists

Most finance apps track what already happened. They show you where your money went. They leave you alone.

UntilFire focuses on what you should do next — and shows you the exact cost, in years of freedom, of each decision you make or avoid.

- Save an extra $500/month? **That's 2.1 years sooner.**
- Take a 10% pay cut? **That's 3.4 years later.**
- Cut one recurring subscription? **That's 8 months back.**

Every input has a visible, quantified consequence. That's the Decision Impact Engine.

---

## The core product promise

UntilFire helps you understand how every financial decision accelerates or delays your path to financial independence — and shows you what to do next.

Users feel **clarity**, **momentum**, and **strategic control** over their future. Not guilt or shame.

---

## Decision Impact Engine

Unlike calculators that return a single number and walk away, UntilFire shows the _delta_: how many years sooner (or later) you reach FIRE based on each choice. The reveal screen includes an interactive decision grid — drag sliders to see how cutting dining or investing more moves your retirement date in real time.

The "Your Highest-Impact Move" card in the dashboard shows the top acceleration opportunity from your live numbers, ranked by years saved: save more, cut expenses, or grow income — whichever moves your date the most.
